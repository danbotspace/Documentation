# Getting Started

This page contains tutorial on how to get started in DBH step by step. All given instructions are taken from `#📗╏getting-started` channel in DBH Discord Server. If something is unsaid make sure to check "Beginner's guidebook" category!

# Join DBH Discord Server!

This step is a key to managing your panel account because panel relies on [@Danbot Hosting#1025](https://discord.com/users/640161047671603205)! You can easily join it using [this link](https://discord.gg/dbh)!

# Create panel account.

Head to either `#🤷╏spam` or `#⌛╏commands` to execute command: `DBH!user new`! After doing this command bot should create a private channel. Follow given instructions to finish creating an account.

# Link your account.

Do `DBH!user link` to link your account. As in the previous step, follow the bot's instructions.

# Create your first server.

Before checking [panel](https://panel.danbot.host/) create your first server using the same bot. You have to execute `DBH!create server <server type> <server name>` to create it. To find out all server types simply do `DBH!server create list`, it will let you know all available server types!
> **Good to know**: You can leave server name blank if you can't decide on a name! Soon on the panel you will be able to change the name.

## Want to delete it?

`DBH!server delete <server id>` is used to delete the server. How do i find out what my server ID is? To find your server ID, you can grab the server ID by:
 * Going into the server's "Startup" tab in the [DBH panel](https://panel.danbot.host/) and seeing it there.
 * Going back to given above channel and typing `DBH!server list` to view all your servers and IDs.
