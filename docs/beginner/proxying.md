# Proxying

Proxying might sound a hard job to do but actually it's not! In this page I used cloudflare to proxy my domain!

## Available DBH domains

* *.never-gonna-give-you-up.xyz
* *.never-gonna-let-you-down.xyz
* *.never-gonna-make-you-cry.xyz
* *.never-gonna-run-around-and-desert-you.xyz
* *.never-gonna-say-goodbye.xyz
* *.never-gonna-tell-a-lie-and-hurt-you.xyz
* *.rick-roll.xyz
t{**Good to know**: By becoming a donator you get an access to *.only-fans.club!}

## Set DNS record

In order to proxy your domain to one of your servers you have to set a DNS record!

![Add a record](/content/add-record.png)

There after clicking "Add record" you have to fill all fields as in the image:

![Fill given fields](/content/proxy-fields.png)

Consider adding this IP ??164.132.74.251??

t{**Note**: if you're using cloudflare consider turning off "Proxy Status".}

After everything is done click "Save" and head to discord!

## Proxy using a command

As always you should use given in [Getting Started](/getting-started) channels. Do `DBH!server proxy <domain> <server id>` in order to proxy your domain to your server. Make sure "domain" field doesn't have neither "http://" nor "https://" in it!

After it is done you have to wait up to 1-2 minutes to see the result. Bot will ping you if it is proxied!

t{**Note**: if you faced a problem and bot didn't give you a success result please consider contacting moderation in order to fix your issue. Also make sure everything is fine in your proxy fields!}
